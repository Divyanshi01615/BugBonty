      { text: "O(1)", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "dsa",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    explanation: "In a balanced BST, the height is log n, so search operations take O(log n) time."

      { text: "Insertion Sort - O(n¬≤)", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "dsa",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    explanation: "Quick Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms."

      { text: "Linked List", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "dsa",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    explanation: "BFS uses a queue to process nodes level by level, ensuring breadth-first traversal."

  // System Design Questions (3)
  {
    question: "What is the primary purpose of a load balancer in system design?",
    options: [
      { text: "Data encryption", isCorrect: false },

    domain: "system-design",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    explanation: "Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and high availability."

  {
    question: "Which database type is best for handling complex relationships?",
    options: [
      { text: "NoSQL Document Store", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Relational Database (SQL)", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "Key-Value Store", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Graph Database for simple relations", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "system-design",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    explanation: "Relational databases excel at handling complex relationships through foreign keys, joins, and ACID properties."
  },
  {
    question: "What is horizontal scaling (scale-out) in system design?",
    options: [
      { text: "Adding more power to existing machines", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Adding more machines to the resource pool", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "Optimizing existing code", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Increasing database connections", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "system-design",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    explanation: "Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to handle increased load, rather than upgrading existing hardware."
  },

  // AI/ML Questions (2)
  {
    question: "What is the main advantage of using ReLU activation function?",
    options: [
      { text: "It prevents vanishing gradient problem", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "It's computationally expensive", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "It always outputs between 0 and 1", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "It's only used in output layers", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "aiml",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    explanation: "ReLU helps prevent vanishing gradients by allowing positive values to pass through unchanged, enabling better training of deep networks."
  },
  {
    question: "Which algorithm is commonly used for dimensionality reduction?",
    options: [
      { text: "K-Means Clustering", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "Linear Regression", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Decision Trees", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "aiml",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    explanation: "PCA is a widely used technique for reducing the number of features while preserving most of the variance in data."
  },

  // Aptitude Questions (2)
  {
    question: "If a train travels 60 km in 45 minutes, what is its speed in km/hr?",
    options: [
      { text: "75 km/hr", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "80 km/hr", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "85 km/hr", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "90 km/hr", isCorrect: false }
    ],
    domain: "aptitude",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    explanation: "Speed = Distance/Time = 60 km / (45/60) hours = 60 km / 0.75 hours = 80 km/hr"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?",
